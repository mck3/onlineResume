			<b>Strict equality</b> is represented by === this is not to be confused with loose equality represented by ==
			How do they differ? When you use three equal signs === no type conversion is done prior to the comparison.
			This means if you have a string and a number they can never be equal because they will never be the same type.
			<div id=”example”>
				<p>
					For example:  &quot;2&quot; === 2 is a false statement the &quot;2&quot; is a string while 2 is an integer.
				</p>
			</div>
			For the two to be equal they must be of the same type while using three equal signs &quot;===&quot;
			<b>Loose equality</b> is represented by two equal signs &quot;==&quot; checks to see if the two values
			are the same type and if not, converts to a common type before the conversion. If they are the same then the result is true,
			and there is no difference between == and ===. According to the lead front-end engineer at Udacity,
			you should never use ==, It&#39;s a frequent source of bugs.
